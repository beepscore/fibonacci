# Purpose
Find the nth Fibonacci number.
Uses memoization to store previous results in a dictionary and reduce execution time.
Use python logging.

# Results

## Execution time
### Recursive algorithm requires exponential time O(2^n)

## How to run unit tests
In terminal, cd to top level directory that contains subdirectory test
Because directory test contains __init__.py, can run tests without explicit "discover test"

    python3 -m unittest
